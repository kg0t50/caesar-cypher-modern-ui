# Caesar Cipher – Modern UI

A modern desktop application implementing the classical Caesar Cipher using Python and CustomTkinter.  
The project combines fundamental cryptography concepts with a clean, responsive graphical user interface.

## Project Overview

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This application allows users to encrypt, decrypt, and brute-force Caesar Cipher text while interacting with a modern, intuitive UI.

The project is designed to demonstrate:
- Understanding of basic cryptographic algorithms
- GUI development in Python
- Clean project structure and documentation

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext using a configurable shift value
- Decrypt ciphertext using a known shift
- Brute-force all possible shifts (0–25)
- Load text from files
- Save output to files
- Copy output to clipboard
- Light and dark theme toggle
- Keyboard shortcuts for faster interaction
- Modern UI with rounded components and subtle animations

## How the Caesar Cipher Works

Each alphabetical character is shifted forward or backward by a fixed number of positions.

Example with a shift of 3:
